<p>This page is part of the documentation for the rEFInd boot manager. If a Web search has brought you here, you may want to start at the <a href="index.html">main page.</a></p>

<hr />

<p>rEFInd is far from perfect. It's based on rEFIt, which has a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161917&atid=821764">list of active bugs</a> on its project page on Sourceforge. I have not studied this bug list in detail for rEFInd's first release, although I've probably fixed a few of those bugs because I encountered them myself. Other bugs I may never fix because I lack the necessary hardware for testing.</p>

<p>This page exists to document some of rEFInd's known bugs and limitations, as well as features I hope to add in the future. Some of the items on this list are things that you may be able to help with, so if you'd like to contribute, feel free to drop me a line!</p>

<p>The following list groups things that need to be done into broad categories. In some cases, there's some ambiguity about how an item might best be classified. Without further ado, then:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Tasks with which non-programmers can help:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>Testing! rEFIt was complex enough that changes such as the ones
	I've made have the potential to disrupt the program's operation in
	unexpected ways. Since the initial 0.2.0 release, I've continued to
	add features to rEFInd, and every new feature is another way for
	bugs to get into the program. I can only test on a handful of
	systems with a limited number of configurations. Therefore, if you
	try rEFInd and run into bugs, please report them to me!</li>

    <li>I have little talent with graphics manipulation programs, so
	rEFInd's boot logo, such as it is, is pretty weak. If you have
	artistic talent and would like to create a rEFInd logo, please feel
	free to send it to me. I won't make any final decision about
	changes until at least June 30 of 2012.</li>

    <li>rEFIt's original design, and hence rEFInd's design, enables easy
	theming by replacing icon files. If you'd like to design a new
	theme for rEFInd, feel free to submit it. I might or might not
	replace the icons it uses now (most of which come from the Oxygen
	Icons package), but I may provide links to themes on this Web site
	(or even host them on the project's Sourceforge page). For more
	information on designing themes for rEFInd, see the <a
	href="themes.html">Theming rEFInd</a> page.</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- Non-programmer help -->

<li><b>Improvements to existing features:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>Currently, rEFInd can detect whether it's compiled for <i>x</i>86
	or <i>x</i>86-64 systems and displays this information in its
	"About" screen (<tt>AboutrEFInd()</tt> in <tt>main.c</tt>). I'd
	like to add detection for Itanium and ARM systems, but I have no
	way to test such changes.</li>

    <li>The code could be more flexible in its handling of the sizes of
	various graphical elements, and particularly drawn text. Prior to
	version 0.2.2, submenu text was invisible on UEFI-based PCs with
	800x600 and smaller displays because of an inability to properly
	crop the graphics fields that hold the text. With version 0.2.2,
	I've put a band-aid on this problem by reducing the field size so
	that it now works on 800x600 displays, but smaller displays still
	suffer from this problem. This is just an example of the
	inflexibility of certain layout issues within rEFInd.</li>

    <li>Although the ICNS file format used by rEFInd supports multiple
	image sizes, if a size that rEFInd needs isn't present in the file,
	rEFInd can't use the icon. The ability to scale images to the
	desired size would be useful.</li>

    <li>I would like to be able to specify the volume on which a boot
	loader resides using a partition GUID value, but extracting a GUID
	from the partition data is harder than extracting the volume's
	label or counting up the filesystem numbers.</li>

    <li>It would be useful to be able to specify paths to boot loaders
	and/or initial RAM disks relative to the rEFInd directory (or the
	boot loader's directory, in the case of initrds).</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- Improvements -->

<li><b>Known bugs that need squashing:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>I'd like to find a way to get rEFInd to launch BIOS boot loaders on
	UEFI-based systems. This option currently works only on
	Macs&mdash;or at least, I've not gotten it to work on any of my
	UEFI-based PCs. (I've done some experiments to try to get this to
	work, but so far without success. If you'd like to help on this, <a
	href="mailto:rodsmith@rodsbooks.com">e-mail me</a> for my
	thoughts.)</li>

    <li>The <a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/gb-hybrid-efi/">Gigabyte
	Hybrid EFI</a> has a bug that causes the allegedly case-insensitive
	<tt>StriCmp()</tt> function to perform a case-sensitive comparison.
	This causes any number of bugs in file matching. For instance:
	Changing the case of icon filename extensions (or various other
	parts of icon filenames) causes icons to be replaced by ugly
	"generic" ones; and rEFInd sometimes appears in its own menu (the
	firmware sometimes returns an all-caps version of the filename, but
	other times returns the filename with the correct case, causing a
	mismatch if the path includes lowercase elements). Some of these
	problems can be overcome by converting both strings to be compared
	to one case before doing the comparison, but others aren't so easy,
	since I think <tt>StriCmp()</tt> is being called internally to the
	EFI. In any event, it'd be nice to fix some of these problems.
	OTOH, this is a workaround for a bug on just one EFI
	implementation, and a dismal one at that, so I'm inclined to just
	let it go.</li>

    <li>The Shutdown option works correctly on Macs, but not on UEFI-based PCs.
        On such systems, Shutdown reboots the computer. This should be
        fixed.</li>

    <li>The media-ejection feature (F12) should be extended to work on
	UEFI-based PCs and early Macs. At the moment, it relies on an
	Apple-specific EFI extension, and I know of no standard EFI way to
	do it.</li>

    <li>The code is in need of review to search for memory leaks and
	similar problems.</p>

    </ul></li> <!-- Known bugs -->

<li><b>New features I'd like to add:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>EFI supports network boots. rEFInd doesn't, but it would be nice if
	it would.</li>

    <li>There's currently no way to create a manual boot stanza for a
	BIOS-booted OS. This isn't a big priority for me personally, but I
	can see how it could be for some people.</li>

    <li>I've received queries about rEFInd's ability to work with Apple's
	whole-disk encryption scheme that's new with OS X 10.7.
	Unfortunately, I lack the hardware to test this, but my
	understanding is that it will work correctly <i>if</i> rEFInd is
	installed in the ESP rather than on the Mac OS X root partition.
	See <a
	href="https://sourceforge.net/p/refind/discussion/general/thread/5c7d0195/">this
	forum thread</a> for more information.</li>

    <li>I'd like to find a way to enable users to enter customizations for
	boot options and then save them to the <tt>refind.conf</tt>
	file.</li>

    <li>It should be possible to override specific auto-detected boot
	loader settings&mdash;say, to disable one specific boot loader or
	change its icon.</li>

    <li>A way to read boot options set via <tt>efibootmgr</tt>,
	<tt>bless</tt>, or similar options from NVRAM to add to the boot
	set would be useful.</li>

    <li>A way to examine and change the NVRAM settings could be useful.
	This would enable a CD-based boot of rEFInd to fix a broken disk
	boot. Perhaps this could be done via a separate tool that could be
	launched much like the shell or <tt>gptsync</tt>.</li>

    <li>I'd like to give the user the ability to set custom options on a
	single-boot basis, similar to what's possible in GRUB.</li>

    </ul></li> <!-- New features -->

    <li><b>Improvements to the EFI drivers:</b>

    <ul>

    <li>The drivers I've built fail to load on a 32-bit Mac Mini; I get an
	"incompatible version" error message at an EFI shell, or an error
	code of 80000019 when rEFInd tries to load them. (These two
	messages are equivalent.) I suspect the problem is related to the
	EFI version 1.<i>x</i> used on the Mac, as opposed to UEFI
	2.<i>x</i> used on PCs. I'm looking into the problem. In the
	meantime, if you have this problem, I recommend tracking down
	equivalent drivers from other sources. (See the <a
	href="drivers.html">drivers page</a> for some pointers.) I'd
	appreciate <a href="mailto:rodsmith@rodsbooks.com">hearing from
	you</a> if you have problems along these lines. Please tell me what
	type of computer you're using, and especially the firmware version
	data (from rEFInd's "about" screen). This may help me narrow down
	the cause.</li>

    <li>Drivers for additional filesystems are required. Given the recent
	shift to ext4fs, that should be the priority; however, other Linux
	filesystems, UDF, and perhaps others would all be welcome
	additions. Also along these lines, adding drivers for Linux LVM and
	RAID setups would be useful, too.</li>

    <li>As detailed on the <a href="drivers.html">drivers page,</a> there
	are performance issues with the drivers on some systems. I suspect
	that most "real" computers aren't greatly affected (in my tests,
	the problem is worst with VirtualBox, and the next worst is a
	system that uses <a
	href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/bios2uefi/">DUET</a>). Nonetheless,
	I'd like to track down the cause and fix it.

    <li>The driver installation procedure could be improved, perhaps by
        adding support for drivers to the <tt>install.sh</tt> script.

    </ul></li> <!-- Drivers -->
