<hr />

<p>This page is part of the documentation for the rEFInd boot manager. If a Web search has brought you here, you may want to start at the <a href="index.html">main page.</a></p>

<hr />

<p><b>Note:</b> I consider rEFInd to be <i>alpha-quality software!</i> Although rEFIt 0.14, upon which rEFInd is based, is beta-quality, I've changed a great deal of the code, and I'm still learning about it. I'm discovering bugs (old and new) and fixing them every day or two. That said, rEFInd is a usable program in its current form on many systems. If you have problems, feel free to drop me a line.</p>

<h2>Getting rEFInd from Sourceforge</h2>

<p>You can find the rEFInd source code and binary packages at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/refind/">its SourceForge page.</a> Note that rEFInd is OS-independent&mdash;it runs before the OS, so you download the same binary package for any OS. You can obtain rEFInd in three different forms:</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.2.5/refind-src-0.2.5.zip/download">A
    source code zip file</a></b>&mdash;This is useful if you want to
    compile the software locally. Note that I use Linux with the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-efi">GNU-EFI</a> development
    tools. rEFIt used an Intel/Microsoft toolchain. Backporting rEFInd to
    that toolchain is theoretically possible, but I've not attempted
    it.</li>

<li><b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.2.5/refind-bin-0.2.5.zip/download">A
    binary zip file</a></b>&mdash;Download this if you want to install rEFInd on
    an <i>x</i>86 or <i>x</i>86-64 computer and have no need to test rEFInd
    first by booting it on an optical disc. This zip file package includes both
    <i>x</i>86 (aka IA32) and <i>x</i>86-64 (aka <i>x</i>64, AMD64, or EM64T)
    versions of rEFInd. Which you install depends on your architecture, as
    described on the <a href="installing.html">Installing rEFInd</a> page.</li>

<li><b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.2.5/refind-cd-0.2.5.zip/download">A
    CD-R image file</a></b>&mdash;This download contains the same files as the
    zip file, but you can burn it to a CD-R to test rEFInd without installing it
    first. (It boots on UEFI PCs, but fails on at least some Macs.) If you like
    it, you can then copy the files from the CD-R to your hard disk. The files
    are named in such a way that the disc should boot on either 64-bit
    (<i>x</i>86-64) or 32-bit (<i>x</i>86) EFI computers. Note that there's a
    bug that causes rEFInd to complain about invalid parameters while scanning
    various directories. You can safely ignore this message, but you'll need to
    press a key to dismiss it. I've included an open source EFI shell program on
    this disc that's not included in the binary zip file, so that you can access
    an EFI shell from a bootable disc even if you don't have an EFI shell
    available from your regular hard disk.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're using another platform, you can give rEFInd a try; however, you'll need to build it from source code yourself or track down a binary from another source. (Perhaps by the time you read this it will be included in Linux distributions built for unusual CPUs.)</p>

<p>If you download a zip file, you'll need to extract the files with a tool such as <tt>unzip</tt>, which is included with Linux and Mac OS X. Numerous Windows utilities also support this format, such as <a href="http://www.pkware.com/software/pkzip/">PKZIP</a> and <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip.</a></p>

<p>You should be able to create a bootable USB flash drive from either the binary zip file or the CD-R image file; just treat the flash drive as if it were a hard disk and install rEFInd as described on the <a href="installing.html">installation page.</a> Using the fallback boot loader name of <tt>EFI/boot/bootx64.efi</tt> is likely to be the most useful way to install rEFInd to a removable medium.</p>

<h2>Getting rEFInd from Your OS's Repositories</h2>

<p>If you use Arch Linux, you can obtain rEFInd from its repositories, in both <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57632">stable</a> and <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57966">git (experimental)</a> releases. The git release is likely to include pre-release bug fixes and new features, but those features may be poorly tested or undocumented.</p>

<p>You can also obtain rEFInd from the <a href="http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nix Packages collection,</a> which creates packages for a number of OSes using its own packaging system.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, no other Linux distribution yet includes rEFInd in its repositories. That's likely to change in time. If you hear of rEFInd being included in an OS's official package set, feel free to <a href="mailto:rodsmith@rodsbooks.com">drop me a line.</a></p>
