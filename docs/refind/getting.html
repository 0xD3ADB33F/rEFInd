<hr />

<p>This page is part of the documentation for the rEFInd boot manager. If a Web search has brought you here, you may want to start at the <a href="index.html">main page.</a></p>

<hr />

<p><b>Note:</b> I consider rEFInd to be <i>beta-quality software!</i> I'm discovering bugs (old and new) and fixing them every few days. That said, rEFInd is a usable program in its current form on many systems. If you have problems, feel free to drop me a line.</p>

<h2>Getting rEFInd from Sourceforge</h2>

<p>You can find the rEFInd source code and binary packages at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/refind/">its SourceForge page.</a> Note that rEFInd is OS-independent&mdash;it runs before the OS, so you download the same binary package for any OS. You can obtain rEFInd in four different forms:</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.6.1/refind-src-0.6.1.zip/download">A
    source code zip file</a></b>&mdash;This is useful if you want to
    compile the software locally. Note that I use Linux with the <a
    href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tianocore/">TianoCore EFI
    Development Kit 2 (EDK2)</a> to build my binaries (below), although the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnu-efi">GNU-EFI</a>
    development tools are also supported. rEFIt used an Intel/Microsoft
    toolchain. Backporting rEFInd to that toolchain is theoretically
    possible, but I've not attempted it.</li>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.6.1/refind-bin-0.6.1.zip/download">A
    binary zip file</a></b>&mdash;Download this if you want to install
    rEFInd and/or its filesystem drivers on an <i>x</i>86 or <i>x</i>86-64
    computer and have no need to test rEFInd first by booting it on an
    optical disc. This zip file package includes both <i>x</i>86 (aka IA32)
    and <i>x</i>86-64 (aka <i>x</i>64, AMD64, or EM64T) versions of rEFInd.
    Which you install depends on your architecture, as described on the <a
    href="installing.html">Installing rEFInd</a> page.</li>

<!--
<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.4.7/refind-bin-gnuefi-0.4.7.zip/download">A
    binary zip file (built with GNU-EFI)</a></b>&mdash;This package is just
    like the preceding one, except that it was built using the GNU-EFI
    development kit rather than the TianoCore EFI Development Kit 2 (EDK2)
    that was used to build the other binary. I originally used GNU-EFI to
    develop rEFInd, but the GNU-EFI toolkit doesn't support the legacy
    (BIOS-mode) boot calls on UEFI-based PCs, so I now consider the
    TianoCore build to be the primary one. (Macs can boot legacy OSes using
    either build.)</li>
-->

<p class="sidebar"><b>Tip:</b> If you want a bootable USB flash drive, download the binary zip file or CD-R image file, prepare a USB flash drive with a FAT32 partition, and then use the <tt>install.sh</tt> program's <tt>--usedefault</tt> option, and perhaps the <tt>--alldrivers</tt> option, as in <tt class="userinput">bash install.sh --usedefault /dev/sdd1 --alldrivers</tt> to install to the first partition on <tt>/dev/sdd</tt>. This procedure should work even on a BIOS-booted computer.</p>

<li><b><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/0.6.1/refind-cd-0.6.1.zip/download">A
    CD-R image file</a></b>&mdash;This download contains the same files as
    the binary zip file, but you can burn it to a CD-R to test rEFInd
    (and its filesystem drivers) without installing it first. (It boots on
    UEFI PCs, but fails on some older Macs.) If you like it, you can then
    copy the files from the CD-R to your hard disk. The files are named in
    such a way that the disc should boot on either 64-bit (<i>x</i>86-64)
    or 32-bit (<i>x</i>86) EFI computers. I've included an open source EFI
    shell program on this disc that's not included in the binary zip file,
    so that you can access an EFI shell from a bootable disc even if you
    don't have an EFI shell available from your regular hard disk. This can
    be an extremely valuable diagnostic tool if you know how to use an EFI
    shell.</li>

<li><b><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/refind/code">Source code via
    git</a></b>&mdash;If you want to peruse the source code in your Web
    browser or get the very latest version (including pre-release bug fixes
    and updates), you can use the Sourceforge git repository. This access
    method is most useful to programmers, or at least to those who are
    familiar with programming tools. Note that if you need to ask "what's
    git?", this is probably not the best way for you to obtain rEFInd.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're using a platform other than <i>x</i>86 or <i>x</i>86-64, you can give rEFInd a try; however, you'll need to build it from source code yourself or track down a binary from another source. (Perhaps by the time you read this it will be included in Linux distributions built for unusual CPUs.)</p>

<p>To extract the files from the zip file images I've provided, you'll need a tool such as <tt>unzip</tt>, which is included with Linux and Mac OS X. Numerous Windows utilities also support this format, such as <a href="http://www.pkware.com/software/pkzip/">PKZIP</a> and <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip.</a></p>

<p>You should be able to create a bootable USB flash drive from either the binary zip file or the CD-R image file; just treat the flash drive as if it were a hard disk and install rEFInd as described on the <a href="installing.html">installation page.</a> Using the fallback boot loader name of <tt>EFI/boot/bootx64.efi</tt> is likely to be the most useful way to install rEFInd to a removable medium.</p>

<h2>Getting rEFInd from Your OS's Repositories</h2>

<p>I know of a small number of pre-packaged versions of rEFInd, either in official OS repositories or in ancillary repositories:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Arch Linux</b>&mdash;You can obtain rEFInd from the Arch
    repositories, in both a stable version (the <tt>refind-efi</tt> package
    installable via <tt>pacman</tt>) and an experimental release built from
    rEFInd's git repository in the Arch User Repository (AUR), under the
    name <tt>refind-efi-git</tt>. The git release is likely to include
    pre-release bug fixes and new features, but those features may be
    poorly tested or undocumented. The last I checked, both builds used the
    Tianocore toolkit, and so support booting BIOS/legacy boot loaders on
    UEFI-based PCs.</li>

<li><b>The <a href="http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nix Packages
    collection</a></b>&mdash;This site creates packages for a number of
    OSes using its own packaging system.</li>

<li><b><a
    href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=refind&project=home%3Amichael-chang%3AUEFI">OpenSUSE
    Build Service (OBS)</a></b>&mdash;This site holds a binary x86-64 build
    of rEFInd that should install on any RPM-based distribution. It doesn't
    completely set up rEFInd, though; it just places the rEFInd files in
    the <tt>/usr/share/refind</tt> directory, and a copy of
    <tt>install.sh</tt> as <tt>/usr/sbin/refind_install</tt>.
    Unfortunately, the script makes assumptions about the locations of
    files and so is useless when files are moved around in this way. Thus,
    you'll need to install manually after installing this RPM, so you might
    as well download the rEFInd binary <tt>.zip</tt> file from Sourceforge
    instead.</li>

</ul>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, no other Linux distribution yet includes rEFInd in its repositories. That's likely to change in time. If you hear of rEFInd being included in an OS's official package set, feel free to <a href="mailto:rodsmith@rodsbooks.com">drop me a line.</a></p>
