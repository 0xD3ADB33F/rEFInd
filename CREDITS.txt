Although I (Roderick W. Smith) am releasing rEFInd in its current form, the
program is not the work of a single person. Others have contributed to the
program, both in its original version (rEFIt) and by providing features
I've incorporated into the current version. Specifically:

* Christoph Pfisterer was the original author of rEFIt. See its Web page,
  http://refit.sourceforge.net, for this version of the program. Christoph
  has therefore contributed more to rEFInd than anybody else, myself
  included; my changes are comparatively small additions to the original
  rEFIt base.

* The Debian project has made a version of rEFIt available that
  incorporates a number of patches, all attributed to Julien BLACHE
  (jblache@debian.org), to enable it to build properly on a Linux system.
  It was this version of rEFIt that I used as a starting point for creating
  rEFInd. See http://packages.debian.org/sid/refit for this version of the
  program.

* The filesystem drivers released with version 0.4.0 rely on a filesystem
  wrapper created by Christoph Phisterer. They then passed through Oracle's
  VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org) and the Clover boot loader
  project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/). The
  filesystem-specific code comes from various sources, including Apple,
  the Linux kernel, and Christoph Phisterer.

* I replaced many of the original rEFIt icons with icons taken from the
  Oxygen Icons project, either from the Oxygen Refit package on its page
  (http://deviantdark.deviantart.com/art/Oxygen-Refit-70199755) or from the
  oxygen-icons version 4.7.4 package on my Gentoo Linux development system.
  These icons are released under the LGPLv3 or GPLv3. If I'm reading the
  pages correctly, the original creator was David Vignoni (aka
  "deviantdark" on the deviantart site).

* The keys icon for MOK keys management comes from the
  kdeartwork-iconthemes-4.8.5 package on Gentoo.

* The Linux Mint icon comes from the Linux Mint 11.1 user guide
  (http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/linuxmint.com/docs/user-guide/)

* The Arch Linux icon was created by ~IDRGSKYWALKER on Deviant Art
  (http://idrgskywalker.deviantart.com/art/Arch-Linux-Logo-186211022).

* The gummiboot icon is taken from the gummiboot Web page
  (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gummiboot) and scaled down
  slightly.

* Dave Vasilevsky (dave@vasilevsky.ca) contributed the disk-ejection
  code.

* John Bressler (jrb1327@gmail.com) contributed the code to boot BIOS-based
  OSes on UEFI-based PCs.

* The code for editing boot options (cursor_left(), cursor_right(), and
  line_edit() in screen.c) is taken from gummiboot.
